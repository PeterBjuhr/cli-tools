# this script will set up everything (hopefully) that you
# need to compile LilyPonda from source - that is, it will:
# - install appropriate version of git
# - download required libraries
# - clone lilypond sources
# - clone scripts by Janek that make building easier
# - set environment variables used by these script.
#
# You will be asked where the lilypond sources and Janek's
# scripts should be placed.
#
# The script was written for Debian-based Linux distributions
# using apt package manager (for example Ubuntu).
