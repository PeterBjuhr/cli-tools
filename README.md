cli-tools
=========

A bunch of scripts, bash aliases etc. that i use in my day-to-day computing.

Particularly interesting is the script for building LilyPond (`lilypond/build-lily.sh`),
and another one that downloads all stuff needed to run that (`lilypond/grab-lily-sources.sh`).
I hope that in the future these scripts will be added to LilyPond itself.
